# The hostname or IP address of the BungeeCord server
#
# - This should be the hostname or IP address that the BungeeIPC plugin is
#   configured for on the BungeeCord proxy. This may or may not be the same as
#   the address that players use to connect to BungeeCord (public vs. private
#   networking for the backend Minecraft servers).
# - If you are using SSL/TLS, it is highly recommended to use the same hostname
#   as the server certificate, as there may be hostname validation when the SSL
#   handshake occurs.
# - If no hostname or IP address is specified, "localhost" will be used
#   (127.0.0.1).
bungeecord_ip: ""

# The port to connect to on the BungeeCord server
#
# - This should be the port number that the BungeeIPC plugins is configured for
#   on the BungeeCord proxy. The combination of the above hostname/IP address
#   and this port number should not match the address that players use to
#   connect to BungeeCord, nor should it match any other IPC Client
#   configuration that you have on any other Minecraft servers that are
#   connected to the same BungeeCord proxy and running BungeeIPC.
# - The port number must be between 1024 and 65536 (inclusive).
# - If no port number is specified, or -1 is specified (the default), then an
#   exception will be thrown.

# Whether to use SSL/TLS or not
#
# - MUST BE MIRRORED.
# - DISCLAIMER: While it is much easier to not use SSL/TLS, this should be
#               restricted to a testing environment. Even if the BungeeCord
#               proxy and the Minecraft server(s) run on the same machine, it is
#               best-practice to use encryption while data is in transit, no
#               matter how "unimportant" the data is.
# - Please note that while the label would indicate using SSL, which has been
#   superseded by TLS, this setting is to enable using SSL/TLS.

# The SSLContext protocol
#
# - Highly recommended to be mirrored. If not, the side that has the lower
#   protocol version as its "best" will determine the protocol version that will
#   be used ("as strong as the weakest link in the chain" analogy).
# - It is recommended to use the latest version of SSL/TLS that your system
#   supports.
# - If no protocol is specified, "TLS" will be used.

# The TLS versions
#
# - Highly recommended to be mirrored. If not, the side that has the lower
#   protocol version as its "best" will determine the protocol version that will
#   be used ("as strong as the weakest link in the chain" analogy).
# - The list of TLS versions that you wish to be able to use.
# - This is separate from the item above in that the above will allow all TLS
#   versions, but this is a whitelist of which versions are actually able to be
#   used.
# - If this list is null or empty, only TLSv1.2 will be whitelisted.

# The Cipher Suites
#
# - Highly recommended to be mirrored. If not, the side that has the weaker
#   cipher suite as its "best" will determine the cipher suite that will be used
#   ("as strong as the weakest link in the chain" analogy).
# - The list of Cipher Suites that are whitelisted for use with the SSLSockets.
# - There are over 40 that the SSLSocket(s) will use by default, some of which
#   are less-than-ideal to use. The following list whitelists the ones that
#   should be used for BungeeIPC.
# - If this list is null or empty, the following cipher suites will be used by
#   default:
#   - "TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384"
